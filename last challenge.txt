That big adventure, he has to do, 
take the change,
being one times a live, 
somebody out of range.
For sure, he has the personality,
is strong enough, mental and physically.
When he succeed, he will be famous for the rest of his live,
and all what’s to do for, is to survive.
--------------------------------------------------------------

The challenge is, to cross the Antarctic-continent,
alone, by feet, with less support and technical equipment.
The finance stands, 
mostly through the advertising reports,
which is combined with delivering exciting pictures,  
and weekly live reports.
The preparation took a long period of time,
now everything is organised, 
the take of should be fine.

Standing in the endless field of snow, looking back to the small point which is the shipping ferry,
he fights against the increasing loneliness, 
looking on his trailer which he now has to carry.
He is fare away from the point of still return,
his mainly task now, 
fighting the white continent, what he has now to learn.
Running against the time is yet the device,
that is the daily routine, the adventures price.

Since six days, outside the tent a snow storm, 
temperature -45 degree.
He thinks was it this now, 
is that the fee.
4 days ago the last drop of liquid,
no way to make water, the stove cocker quitted.
His registration is confusion, paranoia, and unsteadiness, 
over the time he is becoming more wireless.
His last act, 
is the last words to send,
I think, the journey of my live is going to its end.
