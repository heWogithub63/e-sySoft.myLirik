----------------------------------------------------------
From that moment when you impacted in my live,
every thing changed, 
can't understand how until yet I had survive.
I see things now also from an other side
the perspective is different and became wide.
I wants to huge this new world and everybody around
and call it loud, 
I'm happy that I have you found.
--------------------------------------------------------------

Look at that beauty, the sunrise over the see.
Could you hear the wind silent and tender melodie.
Do you feel the touch of the morning thaw on your skin.
Nobody knows what this wonderful day will us bring.
The dawn is fading, the colours are spreading,
I'm happy and there is no left needing.
I feel wonderful and strongly alive,
and the reason for all of this is, 
you are going to be my wife.

Over the years the centre of my existence was always you,
we founded a family and my dreams became true,
For them I fought against the difficults of the live,
organised the finance, often enough to survive.
I did everything for our children and you
to prepare them a good live, 
help them into the shoo.

And now we have becoming old, 
the kid's don't needs any more parents hold.
We still fight side by side always together,
during the years we know each other better and better.
Also when the joints and bones
slowly begins to disable
the wrinkles in the face becomes more visible.
The boundedness between us is still unchanged and strong,
what else there is coming 
I'll go with you through and along.
