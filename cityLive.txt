Yes, there are crowded places,
where people running cross around,
you could see many faces,
all races and different ages are found.
It's comparable with the restriction from ants,
everybody looks on his own advance.
Nobody shares himself about the neighbour.
Important is to think on yourself,
that’s the behaviour.
Here, people are quite close together 
during the day,
but often they have less contact, 
walks his own lonely way.

Small talk is the mostly used communication, what you hear,
The confrontation with an other persons live constitution 
is what they fear.
I have my own problems 
is what's often heard as this vision,
can't confront me with that of others 
in addition.
So the most steers through their own way,
forget that humans needs a social stay.

Social platforms, religion and psychologists are high in boom,
a guarantor for anonymity , to hold the face 
of a perfect working live and consume.
Talking about problems cost now a lot of money,
for this you have to work, what causes problems, is that not funny.
According the costs, 
depressions and emotional disorder rising is to find,
the system for health care ask why is this, 
to hell are they blind.

But city means also, a place where money could grow,
where culture is spreading and art find a show,
where knowledge is pushed, and libraries has a financier,
where entertainment is on a high level and music development is not a chancier.
A place where humans mind is creative, live always in move,
to construct new ideas and find a new groove.
That maybe is it what people attracts to move to this places,
also when space becomes tiny with
a worser live quality, 
in some cases.
