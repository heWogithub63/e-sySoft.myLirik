Purity has not a beginning or an end
it's just a tender moment, not a properity or 
something what is you lend.

It's not buyable, fightable or a effortable effect
it lacks calculation, controll could be not rare  
a total neglegt.

Purity is something what quite not realy exists
inspide of, the terminus in phylosophy further persists.

It's disused from religons as the great goal in live
though this is unreachable nobody could it archive.

If you are lucky and pass this feeling for a secound in time
you will be woundable like a newborne, 
know that everything is in flow, nothing is mine
