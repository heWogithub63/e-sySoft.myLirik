Oh brother I miss you all the time 
since you left me alone
can't understand that I'm still here 
and you had to go, by your own.
I couldn't help you for real, 
during your fight against this deadly disease,
you will be always in my mind, 
also I have to go on, without your accompany.
-------------------------------------------------------------

You where already here when I entered this live,
you had always a year more in your archive.
We sheared the diaper s, the kindergarten and our parents home,
so through our live nobody from us was alone.
We where mostly together in school and the time for free,
we where a good team, what for me with somebody other 
never ever will be.

With nobody I could laugh,
10 minutes and more,
about uncomical things what 
live so with brings,
often we understood us without words,
we could feel what' s the other hurts,
you never flight in academical 
and philosophical heights,
you always preferred 
simplicity and ground-level lights.

You was the one who attracted our friends,
the head of the group, 
you sprayed sympathy and good mood.
You lived your live, solved problems 
just when they where present, 
enjoyed the moments, 
I never thought it would have take 
such a end.
