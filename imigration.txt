Immigration

ï»¿Refrain ---------------------------------------------------------

And there it is, the alarming fear in your brain,
you are standing in front of the border,
again,
could you pass or will they send you back,
in a country full with violence where they kill you, when your leaving is checked.
Since you rescuted this cruel live, 
all what you wants is just to survive.
They treated you like an animal, and what they had so in archive,
you lost your self-confidence, your dignity, and sometimes believing in live.

------------------------------------------------------------


Since human being we wander around,
to stay there where sweet water is springing, 
and food could grow on the ground,
where nature allows us 
to raise childes and living is possible until the end,
where existing is madeable in peace and contentment.
To do so is a basic liberality, 
that is untouchable and can't be changed by any community.



The earth and her ground is just owned by the nature, 
also if humans creates laws, borders and fences to engage her.
That's why it's everybody s responsibility,
to give them, immunity
who are constraint to leave their community.
A immigration is often a new start 
with nothing than yourself against suspiciousness,
it's hard to rebuild an existence in a alien culture, alone, 
confidence less.



All over the world, also right now humans 
starts to wander,
the reasons catastrophe, diseases, violence or hunger.
For them, surely a difficult and sorrowful choice,
they have to go in a fearing future, 
to unknown cultures with a stranger voice.
From one moment to the next it could happens also to you,
so be that aware, and welcome the strangers, 
like they would do.
