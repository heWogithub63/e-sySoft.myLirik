Hate a  mostly longlasting feeling,
a drilling  sensation  often combined
with the wish of killing.
The reasons envy, greed or jealousity 
not rare due a preeducated feeling
of inferority.

The hated person a welcome to built
a punishing bag
wich can be a sign for a
mental stabilisation lack.

Hate destroys friendships
and not rare departs people in  a
strain of marrige.

It could create violence until to
be a murder
constrains people to cross a moral border.

Hate is compareable with the sensation
called 'love dependency'
it is to find the same aggressive and
long lasting intensivity.
