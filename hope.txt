If you are on the top of a dead end road
and it feels like on a sinking boat,
If everything is hope and target less,
your live seems without happyness.
Then you should hear some kind,
a inner voice in your mind.
'if you can't see no way, there is no sense,
it will come a light from anywhere with confidence'

Live isn't just straight, sometimes a hit against the chest,
then slow down, take a rest.
Sort your emotions, change the perspective,
reset the system, delete the negative.
For shure you will find a new view of the things,
at the end of the day it will bring you total new links.

A new try includes the pasts expirience
it leads to success and new confidence.
