You are the shit storm in our society,
You are the flat borne without loyalty.
You miss discipline and integrity, 
You don't know dignity and any proud,
Nothing more to say,
I just spit out.

Your live is comparable with that of a hyena
fare away from the proud of a Lyon.
Respect and honour is with you missing
but your favour is boot licking and ass kissing.
You are shit friendly to everyone everywhere
not failing a denunciation without care

You think the others could have effort in live
you are more clever, steel from them, 
when necessary with a knife.
The others have a workload to do due to survive
you live from the effects like a wood louse in animals live.

The sadness of all that, it's unbelievable,
unfair behaviour often makes existence easier
and more comfortable.
In consequence, the community of parasites is increasing,
that poisoned living-together and humens-social-being.
