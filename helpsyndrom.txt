You are the best, what would we do
without you, is what they wants to hear,
loosing this attraction is the worst, what they fear.
Believing the unrealistic dream is the highest permission
for that they do everything, creating a vision
from goodness and a lovely world in happiness
social stay without violence and roughness.

Pink is the favoured colour and they prefer softness,
destroying their bubble leads to aggression and angriness.
As reaction, they are going to be offended
the only way to change this,
asking for forgiveness that's pretended.

To reach impression, and to be somebody special
often runs them in the role of a victim and a casual.
Unfortunately there are the others, 
who abuses this needing
and that brings them often to their limit
develops, not rare, a burn out or an out-bleeding.
