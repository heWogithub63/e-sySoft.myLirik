Rolling with a bike, how I find,
is often refreshing the mind,
could bring you helpful solutions,
can blow away confusions.
Moving I guess is the meditative effect ,
realising starting and arriving the brains neglect.
When the landscape is gliding,
just feels freeing and the conscious is widening.
--------------------------------------------------------------

The mountain laughs about you,
or it seems like,
you will never get me with your bike,
but that just demands the fight out,
your proud is kicked and you say it loud,
I'm going to get you under, 
and than we will see who is it have to wonder.
The battle is opened, the sweet running, you give all,
pushing the bike uphill from one curve to the next, trying not to fall,
that needs all your condition, breathing is high frequent,
the muscles are burning,
but you have to be consequent.

A long distance is laying before,
the street seems to be endless, 
but that you try to ignore.
You are pushing the paddles as strong 
as you can,
to give your team wind shadow for a few km.
The sun is fleering on the asphalt,
the landscape running without a halt.
And there it is, the sudden endorphins input,
causes high level performance, muscle power is now like it should.
It feels like flying over the streets,
the bike lost contact, just through the power of your feets.

Travelling by bike could be a exhausting business,
the heavy load of the luggage is often without forgiveness.
You have to fight against all kind of weather,
always in direct contact with  mother nature.
But the journey from one point to the next,
let's feel you like you would be the best,
you do it just with your own physical power, 
that's the payment for the efforts, in every hour
