You want me on my knees, bagging you please, 
but I surely never will this apply, 
don't ask me why.
You say I'm anyway to proud, 
I say with a straight lifted head yes,
sometimes to loud.

We had this long lasting fight about women's right. 
They wants equality to men's  
in every issue with quick change, 
wants men behind them in range. 
They wants their obligations in share,
but not missing men's take care.
Now you are offended, no sex is pretended. 
You !!! Wives

Standing in the storm, feeling like a worm.
Rain is clapping in your face and everything is cold,
you are helpless,  feeling old.
The ship is cutting high waves, makes you nausea and males.
The aim is to survive on your own, 
nature don't knows any pardon.
You !!! Nature ....

I'm the doctor you the patient I should take care
you are laying here full with drugs and monitored, 
that is not fair.
I shrug out of my sleep, thinking have I all done, 
I should lay there you was always the better one.
Than the phone call I mostly fear, the nurse of the ward, 
I'm so sorry Sir, he passed by.
I can't say any more a word, 
just sadly cry.
You !!! God ....
