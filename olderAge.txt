There comes a time when you see that also your way has an end,
that your time frame is limited which is you lend.
But don't follow the temptation to stop now your way to be,
there is more time left than you could see.
-------------------------------------------------------------

More often you feel now that something of your body hurts,
but you will also be aware for a more intensive singing of the birds.
The register from a limited time,
increases a better feeling,
for what all with you are dealing,
So you will see that all things makes just sense,
if there is a beginning and a end.
Eternity would rob most things the live-content,
time would loose plausibility, 
without a end.


Older age could be quite rich on positivity,
if you don't neglect the physical and psychological activity,
if you let other's participate on your knowledge, 
cause your live experience is wide,
and bring in your functionality in the communities composite.
Use humans skills for communication,
to transfer your wisdom to the following generation

The autumn is one of the most beautiful times of the year,
so also has the autumn of the live nice colours, 
there is nothing what you have to fear.
Sure the physical ability is diminishing,
but in most cases that is something to compensating.
The live experience, and the knowledge 
are ones of the great transients,
since humans being, had every generation 
a benefit from there ancients.
