Hold me out, I'm not responsible in this play,
therfore we have the leaders, I just followed their way.
That's what the mob calls out, never takes position
stretches their finger to the others, 'it was their ambition'.
If something went wrong, they turn a round 180 degree,
for the consequences of the past they would never pay the fee.

From one day to the next friends becomes enemies,
dosn't matter if they have to crawel or bagging please.
If you offer them a punishing bag,
they will clash it with out mercy breaking its neck.
Disclaim, for that what has happend, the liabilty
pretend ignorance and purity.

The mob favoures always their own advance,
mostly characterless with loud response.
