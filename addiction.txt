And there it is the addiction,
the pulsing in your brain, 
I wants to drift away in the world of fiction,
it's not resistible, what a shame.
The cry in your mind, 
come give me the stuff,
also if it's bad for the health and your live go's down to the raff.
Your body starts shaking, and you give him the needs,
the withdraw braking, 
it knocks you off your feeds.

--------------------------------------------------------------

You are laying beside him, feeling awefull and disguised,
you have done it again, 
breaking the rules they have you advised.
You leave the place as fast as you can,
thinking it doesn’t matter,
the money is in your pocket, and if you are stoned, 
then feeling becomes better.
You wanted to become clean, starting a new better live,
but your only thought now is,
washing down the memories of the night, just to survive.

Sitting together, laughing and celebrating with your friends,
you where always the funny guy, producing mood with good sense,
that makes you special, triggered by nicotine and alcohol use,
but what shell’s, 
you have nothing anymore to loose.
Over the years you registered the increase becomes bad,
but it doesn’t mater, you think you can control that.

When you crashed in my live, 
the impact was soft,
I was not aware,
how much this will me cost,
before I was free,
lived unbounded sexuality,
now I wants to take care,
want everything to share.
Before I pronounced, 
love as a stupid thing,
now I'm addicted to you 
I have no idea what ever this will bring.
