---------------------------------------------------------
Homeless, you feel like a tree 
without roots,
the lightest wind knocks you out off your boots.
Homeless, living on the streets,
often enough with cold, wet feets.
Homeless, you are the play ball from rain, wind and coldness, 
the most makes a bow around you, 
what produces isolation 
and loneliness.
-------------------------------------------------------

Strolling through the streets, it's cold and breezy,
couldn't found a place for sleep, feeling lost and dizzy.
With hope for the sun waiting for the dawn,
maybe than it become a little warm.
The city is quiet, they are in their warm beds,
I'm still looking for a bench 
or something like where you could lay in length.
That is now the time where you starts thinking,
is this yet your live, homeless and your body is stinking.

Once I was successful in business and private live,
had a large house children and a wife.
I had known the game was risky, there was a lot of money in play,
Despite of I acted often briskly,
in review that was the wrong way.

In good and in bad times, 
was just a setted phrase 
during the good days.
She left me and took the children 
and most money away,
so I lost my believing in females,
couldn't any more with an other stay.

My last refuge was lonlieness, 
nobody any more kissed me,
and the solution was often enough 
a bottle of whisky.

You are restless, walking around,
the mind is confused there was no warm place to found.
The freezing bite you in the toes,
the hands are numb, you have nothing any more to loose.
The others are turning away, 
won't to see your helplessness 
in this winters day.
With the time you becomes tired,
think that is no live 
in witch you want further stay,
think I'm going to lay me down here
death will drift me away.
